# Return-Campus-Resident-Management-System
This project is a simple simulation of WKUâ€™s return-campus management system. As a respond to the campus epidemic prevention and control requirements, this system enables administrators to easily process return-campus applications, arrange dormitory distribution, and manage information database which can be completed by simple button operations.
The return-campus management system consists of two main functions:
(1)  Record return-campus applications into database. Two separated portals are designed for students and faculties respectively.
	(2) Modifying resident and room information, including record of arrival, changing rooms, put high-risk students into quarantine, and reject return-campus applications.

Java Swing & AWT are used to develop a graphical interface to display room and resident information. Data can be managed easily through different function buttons. 

Apache Derby is chosen to be our database tool. Derby database is accessed into our project via an embedded JDBC driver.
